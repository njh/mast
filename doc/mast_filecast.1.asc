NAME
----
mast_filecast - Audio file broadcaster

SYNOPSIS
--------
'mast_filecast' [options] <address>[/<port>] <filename>


DESCRIPTION
-----------
mast_filecast(1) reads audio from an audio file, encodes it to the chosen 
paylad format and then sends it out encapsulated in an RTP packet. The format of 
the audio file can be anything supposed by libsndfile (AIFF, Wave, Sun Audio etc).
The sample rate and number of channels should be the same as the chosen payload type.

The address can either be a unicast, multicast, IPv4 or IPv6 address.

The port number should be an even number (RTCP reports are sent one port higher).
If no port number is specified, then the default RTP port number (5004) is used.


OPTIONS
-------
-h::
	Return usage and version information.

-t::
	Sets 'TTL' (Time To Live) for packets sent. Packets will ignored after
	they have passed this number of routers. Default is 5, maximum is 127.

-p <payload>::
    'Payload type' of the encoded packets. MAST currently only supports
    the following four static payload types. The default is 'L16'.
    - *PCMU* - 8khz,    Mono
    - *PCMA* - 8khz,    Mono
    - *GSM*  - 8khz,    Mono
    - *LPC*  - 8khz,    Mono
    - *L16*  - 44.1khz, Mono or Stereo
    - *MPA*

-o <name=value>::
    Set a MIME Type parameter option for chosen payload type. Supported options are:
    - *MPA* - MPEG Audio
        * 'bitrate' (in kbps)
        * 'mode' (joint_stereo, stereo, single_channel, dual_channel)
		
-z <size>::
	'Maximum Payload size' of the packets. Allows you to choose the length of the payload
	data (in bytes) for each packet transmitted. This is usually a number between
	300 bytes and 1450 bytes. The actual packet size will be determined by the number of 
	blocks of 160 samples of audio that can be stored in the packet's payload.
	The maximum transmission unit (MTU) is determined by your networking equipment.
	Also be careful of IP-in-IP tunnelling as packets will have two IP headers which
	makes it more likely that the packet will be too big and get fragmented.
	
-s <ssrc>::
	By default a random SSRC is generated, however if you want to ensure that an SSRC
	remain constant between invocations of the program, then you may specify it here as 
	a hexadecimal number.
	
-d <dscp>::
	The Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) value specifies a packet's
	Per-Hop-Behavior (PHB) along its path to its destination. It is a Quality of 
	Service (QoS) technique that can be used to provide better than best effort 
	packet delivery. The default PHB is Best Effort. Valid arguments are:
	- 'BE'  Best Effort
	- 'EF'  Expedited Forarding
	- 'AF11' to 'AF43'	Assured Forwarding
	- 'CS0' to 'CS7'  Classes 0 to 7
	
-l::
	'Loop' the audio file. Repeat playing the audio file when the end is reached.
	


EXAMPLES
--------

`mast_filecast -p L16 -l 233.122.222.1 audiofile.wav`

Repeatedly send an audio file to the multicast group 233.122.222.1, port 5004.
The audio file is stereo, with a sample rate of 44.1kHz and will be sent 
uncompressed using payload type 10.

`mast_filecast -p GSM 152.78.64.103/4000 audiofile-8khz.wav`

Read in an audio file, with a sample rate of 8kHz, encode it to GSM and sent it 
to the unicast address 152.78.64.103, port 4000.
